			<h4>The Basics</h4>
			<p>Blackjack is a common game of chance that is typically played in casinos. It is also called '21' and is easy to learn, but difficult to master. </p>
			<p> The object of the game is to score 21 points without going over and to beat the dealer.</p>
			<p> The game starts with each player being dealt two cards, both face up. The dealer receives cards face down. Each player has an opportunity to 'hit' and receive another card or 'stay' and play moves to the left.</p>
			<p> Although House Rules vary, in this game, the dealer must 'hit' a soft 17 and stay on all hands of 17 points or higher.</p>
			<p>If any player, including the dealer, scores higher than 21, they bust and lose.</p>

			<h4>Split</h4>
			<p>A player can 'split' their cards if they draw two of the same value (suit is not important). Each card is now treated as the first card in a new hand. The dealer deals a second card to the first hand and the player may choose to hit or stay, as they would a normal hand. (The exception is if Aces are split and then the player receives only one additional card.) Once the player chooses to stay on the first hand, play moves to the second. Hands can be split an infinite number of times and each requires an equivalent bet.</p>

			<h4>Double Down</h4>
			<p>A player can 'double down' after receiving their first two cards to receive only one additional card. This move is strategic when the player believes they will beat the dealer with a three-card hand.</p>

			<h4>Points</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>Numbered cards have a value as shown on the card.</li>
				<li>Facecards (Jacks, Queens and Kings) have a value of 10.</li>
				<li>Aces can hold a value of 1 or 11, and can change throughout the hand depending on what is strategic.</li>
			</ol>
			
			<h4>Bets</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Blackjack pays 3:2.</li>
				<li>All other winning hands pay 2:1</li>
			</ul>
